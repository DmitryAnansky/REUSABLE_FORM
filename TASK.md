Design a REUSABLE form component that meets the following requirements:

- The initial state should be an empty input box, and an ADD button.
- If the user enters input text to the box, clicking ADD should add that text to a list.
- There should be a way to delete a list element.
- On form submit, the list elements should be submitted as an array.
- Please provide documentation on how to implement your component.

Please use only straight HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Do not use any CSS frameworks or external Javascript libraries.

Your submission will be evaluated on the following:
- Functionality - Does the component satisfy all the requirements?
- Reusability - How easily reusable is the component?
- Design - Does the component look nice? Is the user experience pleasant?
- Style & Documentation - Is the code written in a clean and easily readable way? Does the documentation clearly and simply explain how to implement and use the component?

Feel free to include additional interactions as you see fit. Style to taste. Have fun!
